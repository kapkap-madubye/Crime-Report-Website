<br>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<br>
<h5>
The Green campaign exists to advocate for the immediate and drastic <br>
action that is required to avoid the catastrophic destabilization of the <br>
world climate,With the probable exception of all-out conflict with contemporary<br>
weapons of mass destruction, climate destabilization has become the greatest <br>
threat to our planet and everyone on it. We don't know how much irrevocable <br>
harm we've already done, but we do know that if we don't act now, the <br>
consequences will be many times worse.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Green  was established to ensure that we get the action we need - on a <br>
local, national, and, most importantly, international level - to reduce <br>
damaging climate change and its catastrophic consequences. To that end, Green <br>
aims to raise awareness about the seriousness and urgency of the threat posed<br>
 by climate change as well as to persuade those in positions of power to take <br>
 meaningful action as soon as possible. Green exists to combat ignorance, <br>
 short-term greed, and vested interests that stand in the way of taking action<br>
  that is desperately needed.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
Green in particular, organizes public demonstrations in order to bring together<br>
as many people as possible and form a mass movement to advocate for our objectives<br>
Green is working to find a global solution to a global problem by pushing for a worldwide <br>
emissions reductions pact that is both effective in preventing catastrophic climate destabilization<br>
and equitable in its implementation. To be effective, such a pact must guarantee reductions <br>
in global total greenhouse gas emissions that are deemed necessary to avoid adverse climate change<br> 
by a broad majority of competent scientific opinion. Green goal is to raise awareness about <br>
individuals who are most responsible for obstructing or delaying the critically needed progress<br>
toward an international climate accord.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Green recognizes that the issue of global climate destabilization has far-reaching consequences for<br>
social justice and global inequity.The wealthier nations have done most of the damage to the earth's<br>
atmosphere so far, but the poorest will suffer the most and most quickly. Green recognizes that any solution<br>
must be as equitable as possible,integrating social justice principles and not aggravating global inequities.<br>
Green aspires to bring together as many people as possible who share our broad goals of pressing for immediate <br>
climate action and lowering global emissions. As a result, Green does not campaign on the crucial but more detailed<br>
topics of how to best achieve these emission reductions, acknowledging that supporters will hold differing and passionately<br>
held views on these matters.
