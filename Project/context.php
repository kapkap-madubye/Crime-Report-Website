        <h2>What is Climate change?</h2><br>
        <p>It is the long-term shift in temperatures and weather patterns, to which human activities contribute heavily 
           primarily<br> by burning fossil fuels such as coal,oil, gasoline, and natural gas.
           This results in greenhouse gas emissions hence<br> we experience heat waves, droughts,
           and floods, happening more and frequently and are becoming intense.</p>
           
        <br>

        <p>Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act 
        like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping <br>the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Examples of greenhouse gas emissions that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane.<br>
            These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example: 
            Clearing land and<br> forests can also release carbon dioxide. Landfills for garbage are a major source of methane emissions.
            Energy,<br> industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the main emitters.

       
        </p><br>

        <h2>Greenhouse gas concentrations are at their highest<br>levels in 2 million years</h2><br>

        <p>Emissions continue to rise. As a result, the Earth is now about 1.1°C warmer 
           than it was in the late 1800s.<br> The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record.</p>
        <br>   

        <p>Many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures,
           but temperature rise is only the beginning of the story.<br>
           Because the Earth is a system, where everything is connected, changes
            in one area can influence changes in all others.


        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            The consequences of climate change now include, among others, intense droughts, water scarcity, severe fires,<br> rising 
            sea levels, flooding, melting polar ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.

        <h2>People are experiencing climate change in diverse ways</h2>
        <br>

        <p>
            Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food, housing, safety and work. 
            Some of us are already more vulnerable<br> to climate
             impacts, such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries.Conditions like sea-level rise and<br> saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are putting <br> people at risk of famine. 
             In the future, the number of “climate refugees” is expected to rise.

        <h1>Causes of global warming</h1><br>

        <h2>1.Cities and Pollution</h2><br>
        <p>
        Cities are major contributors to climate change.According to UN Habitat, cities consume 78 per cent of the world’s 
        energy and<br> produce more than 60 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, they account for less than 2 per cent of the Earth’s surface.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
        The sheer density of people relying on fossil fuels makes urban populations highly vulnerable to the effects 
        
         of climate change.<br> Fewer green spaces exacerbate the problem. According to the IPCC report, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would<br>“require
         rapid and far-reaching transitions in uses of energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems.”
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
        The effects of climate change are worse among poor and low-income communities, in part because many live on the
         margins of society,<br>in unstable structures, and in areas more susceptible to 
        flooding, landslides, earthquakes, but also because of inadequate capacities, <br>inadequate resources and
         reduced access to emergency response systems. This is even more pronounced in developing countries.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        Pollution, mostly associated as a by-product of urban landscapes, is also linked with climate change.
         Both climate change and air pollution<br> are exacerbated by 
        the burning of fossil fuels, which increase CO<sup>2</sup> emissions, the cause of global warming.

        <h2>2.Deforestation</h2><br>

        <p>
        Deforestation is the clearing, destroying, or otherwise removal of trees through deliberate, natural, or accidental means. It can occur in any area<br> densely populated by trees
         and other plant life, but the majority of it is currently happening in the <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/forests_practice/deforestation_fronts_/" target="_blabk">Amazon rainforest</a>.
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>
        Deforestation occurs for a number of reasons, including farming, with 80% of deforestation resulting from extensive 
        cattle ranching, and logging <br>for materials and development. It has been happening for thousands of years, arguably since 
        man began converting from hunter/gatherer to agricultural<br> based societies, and required larger, unobstructed tracks of land 
        to accommodate cattle, crops, and housing. It was only after the onset of the modern <br>era that it became an epidemic.
        </p><br>
        <div class="greenhouse-scale">

        <br>
        <h3>Environmental Effects of Deforestation From Above</h3>
        <br>
        <h4>Loss of Habitat</h4>
        <br>
        <p>One of the most dangerous and unsettling effects of deforestation is the loss of animal and plant species due 
            to their loss of habitat.<br> 70% of land animals and plant
             species live in forests. Not only does deforestation threaten species known to us, but also those unknown.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        The trees of the rainforest that provide shelter for some species also provide the canopy that regulates the temperature. 
        Deforestation<br> results in a more drastic temperature variation from day to night, much like a desert, which could prove fatal for many inhabitants.
        </p><br>
        <div class="greenhouse-scale">
            <img src="images/def.jpg">
        </div><br>

        <h4>Water in the Atmosphere</h4><br>

        <p>The trees also help control the level of water in the atmosphere by helping to<a style="text-decoration:none; color:green;" href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-deforestation-affecting-global-water-cycles-climate-change" target="_blank"> regulate the water cycle</a>.
             In deforested areas, <br>there is less water in the air to be returned to the soil. This then causes dryer 
             soil and the inability to grow crops</p>

        <br><h2>Solutions</h2>  
        <br>
        <h3>1.Save energy at home</h3><br>
        
        <p>
        Much of our electricity and heat is powered by coal, oil and gas. Use less energy by
         lowering your heating and cooling,<br> switching to<strong> LED light bulbs and energy-efficient electric appliances</strong>, 
         washing your laundry with cold water or<br> hanging things to dry instead of using a dryer.
        </p><br>
        <h3>2.Walk,Cycle or take Public Transport</h3><br>
        <p>
        The world’s roads are clogged with vehicles, most of them burning diesel or petrol. Walking or riding a bike instead of driving<br>
         will reduce greenhouse gas emissions – and help your health and fitness. For longer distances, consider taking a train or bus.<br> And carpool whenever possible.<br>

        <h3>3.Eat more Vegetables</h3><br>
        <p>
        Eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, and less meat and dairy, can significantly lower your 
        environmental impact.<br> Producing
         plant-based foods generally results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions and requires less energy, land and water.
        </p><br>
        <br>
        <h3>4.Throw away less food</h3><br>
        <p>
        When you throw food away, you're also wasting the resources and energy that were used to grow, produce, package, and transport it.<br>
        And when food rots in a landfill, it produces methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. So use what you buy and compost any leftovers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>5.Choose eco-friendly products</h3><br>
        <p>
        Everything we spend money on affects the planet. You have the power to choose which goods and services you support.<br>
        To reduce your environmental impact, buy local and seasonal foods, and choose products from companies who use resources<br>
         responsibly and are committed to cutting their gas emissions and waste.
        </p><br>
        <h3>6.Reduce, reuse, repair & recycle</h3>
        <p><br>
        Electronics, clothes, and other items we buy cause carbon emissions at each point in production, from the extraction of raw<br> 
        materials to manufacturing and transporting goods to market. To protect our climate, buy fewer things, shop second-hand, repair<br>
         what you can, and recycle.
